# CONSTEXPR CRYPTO

Hash and cipher algorithm implementations infinitely faster

## And without joke ?

C++ constexpr of some hash / cipher algorithm. 

Allow to use some cryptography / hashing / random algorithm at compile time.

## Why ?

- Testing & mocking: validate your algorithms at compile time with some static_assert

- Advanced compile time data-structure

- Because why not ?
